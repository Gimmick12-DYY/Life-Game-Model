# Life-Game-Model
This is a simple HTML program that simulates artificial life models using basic physics properties (attraction and repulsion between particles)

The program is largely based on a pre-existing program, but a few features were added, including the application of Brownian Force as random motions and improved visuals.

The simulation program provides a few presets: 1) Cell Division Mode, which simulates the division and death of cells, 2) Neural Network Mode, which simulates the interaction of neurons in a neural network.
