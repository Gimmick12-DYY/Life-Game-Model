# Life-Game-Model
This is a simple HTML program that simulates artificial life models using basic physics properties (attraction and repulsion between particles)

The program is largely based on a pre-existing program (https://github.com/hunar4321/particle-life), but a few features were added, including the application of Brownian Force as random motions and improved visuals.

The simulation program provides a few presets: 1) Cell Division Mode, which simulates the division and death of cells, 2) Neural Network Mode, which simulates the interaction of neurons in a neural network.

Note that it is recommended to keep the number of particles in the config at most 1000, otherwise the rendering efficiency and FPS of the browser will be compromised dramatically.
